# ShameOnYou.com

People-powered consumer accountability network: expose scams, junk fees, shrinkflation, dark patterns and greenwashing — and get free help.

**Live:** https://webworksa1.github.io/shameonyou-com/ (GitHub Pages, free plan)

## Stack
Pure static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS — no build step, runs on the GitHub Pages free plan.

- `assets/js/config.js` — one file to go live (AdSense, GA4, YouTube IDs, donation links, contest end date).
- `assets/js/data.js` — expandable content: add Hall of Shame entries, scam alerts and guides here; pages render them automatically.
- `assets/js/partials.js` — shared footer, lead-gen form, newsletter band, cookie banner and mobile CTA (edit once, updates every page).
- `assets/js/main.js` — forms, multi-step lead-gen, donations, tools, quiz, voting, ads loader, consent.

## Go-live checklist
1. **Forms** — all forms post via FormSubmit AJAX. The very first submission triggers a one-time *activation email* to the site inbox; click “Activate” once and every form works from then on.
2. **AdSense** — put your publisher ID in `assets/js/config.js` (`adsenseClient`) and in `ads.txt`.
3. **Analytics** — optional GA4 ID in `config.js`.
4. **YouTube** — add video IDs in `config.js → videos`.
5. **Donations** — PayPal works out of the box; add Ko-fi / Buy Me a Coffee / Patreon / Stripe links in `config.js` to show those buttons.
6. **Custom domain** — add a `CNAME` file with `shameonyou.com`, point DNS A records to `185.199.108.153`, `.109`, `.110`, `.111`, and `www` CNAME → `webworksa1.github.io`. Then replace `webworksa1.github.io/shameonyou-com/` with `shameonyou.com/` in page `<head>` tags, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
7. Submit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console.
